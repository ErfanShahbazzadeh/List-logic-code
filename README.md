# Project-1-py
A practice project for university
This is a Python class that extends the built-in `list` type, adding custom methods for inserting, deleting, searching, and displaying list elements with added flexibility.


## Features

The `Custom_list` class provides several functions:

1. **Insert** - Inserts an element at a specified index in the list.
2. **Delete_by_value** - Deletes the first occurrence of a specified value in the list.
3. **Delete_by_index** - Deletes the element at a specified index.
4. **Display** - Custom display method that prints elements in a formatted way.
5. **Append** - Appends an element to the end of the list.
6. **Reverse** - A static method to reverse any given list in place.
7. **Search_by_value** - Searches for the first occurrence of a specified value in the list and returns its index.

## How to Use
The program will ask the user what function should it use in the while loop


## Notes
- `Reverse` will reverse the order of the list and also print it out.
- `Display` provides a customized print format for better readability.
